This is a summary of the findings of the EDA Performed on the IMDB Dataset


It appears as if there is a bit of an issue with reading some data on tableau: one field is marked as IsAdult. It is supposed to a binary int (bool), but it appears that some other numbers have got in there. They also appear to be specifically years. I think this is a parsing issue. I attached an image of the issue here in the Images directory.

Potential relationships to be tested:
		A recent movie with good reviewd may overshadow other movies and cause them to have worse reviewes
		
		People who work on one good movie will likely work on another good movie

		Movies with good reviews have high viewer count

		TV show episodes recieve similar reviews to other episodes in the series
